For a direct link, <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/david-eck/introduction-to-computer-graphics/paperback/product-22290648.html">click&nbsp;here</a>. Note that I do not make any money
from this book, so you should not feel any obligation to buy it!  In any case, the
on-line version is preferred, since it contains interactive content.</li>
