The image files in this folder are in "Silicon Graphics RGB"
format.  They were originally downloaded in other formats
and were converted to .rgb files using the Gimp image
manipulation program.

.rgb is a simple file format.  The images can be loaded
into GL_RGBA format textures using the readrgb.c file
that can be found in this folder.  It was downloaded 
from http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/sgirgb/ 
in June 2021.
