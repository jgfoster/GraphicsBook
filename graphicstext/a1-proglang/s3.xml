<section title="The JavaScript Programming Language" id="proglang.3">

<p1>JavaScript is a programming language that is used on Web pages.
It was first developed by Netscape (the predecessor of Firefox) at about the
same time that Java was introduced, and the name JavaScript was chosen
to ride the tide of Java's increasing popularity.  In spite of the similar
names, the two languages are quite different.  Actually, there is no
standardized language named JavaScript. The standardized language is
officially called ECMAScript, but the name is not widely used in practice,
and versions of JavaScript in actual web browsers don't necessarily
implement the standard exactly.</p1>

<p>Traditionally, it has been difficult for
programmers to deal with the differences among JavaScript implementations
in different web browsers.  We will use JavaScript to work with the
<word>HTML canvas</word> element, a fairly recent addition to <word>HTML</word>.
Fortunately for us, the browsers that support the canvas element 
use a fairly standardized version of JavaScript, and that will allow us 
to ignore most of the incompatibilities that have plagued web developers.</p>

<p>This page is a short overview of JavaScript.  If you really want to learn JavaScript in detail,
you might consider the book <i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i>,
by David Flanagan (although the current, sixth edition is getting a little old).</p>


<subsection title="The Core Language" id="proglang.3.1">

<p>JavaScript is most closely associated with web pages, but it
is a general purpose language that is used in other places too.  There is
a core language that has nothing to do with web pages in particular, and
we begin by looking at that core.</p>

<p>JavaScript has  a looser syntax than either Java or C.  One example is the use
of semicolons, which are not required at the end of a statement, unless another
statement follows on the same line.  Like many cases of loose syntax rules, this
can lead to some unexpected bugs.  If a line is a legal statement, it is considered to
be a complete statement, and the next line is the start of a new statement&mdash;even if
you meant the next line to be a continuation of the same statement.  I have been 
burned by this fact with code of the form</p>

<pre>return
       "very long string";</pre>
       
<np>The "return" on the first line is a legal statement, so the value on the next line
is not considered to be part of that statement.  The result was a function that returned
without returning a value.  This also depends on the fact that JavaScript will accept
any expression, such as the string on the second line, as a statement, even if evaluating
the expression doesn't have any effect.</np>

<p>Variables in Java are not typed.  That is, when you declare a variable, you
don't declare what type it is, and the variable can refer to data
of any type.  Variables are declared using the keyword <b>var</b>, and they
can optionally be initialized when they are declared:</p>

<pre>var x, y;
var name = "David";</pre>

<np>It is OK in JavaScript to declare the same variable more than once; a declaration
just says that the variable exists.
JavaScript also allows you to use variables without declaring them.  However, doing
so is not a good idea.  You can prevent the use of undeclared variables,
as well as certain other unsafe practices, by including the following statement
at the beginning of your program:</np>

<pre>"use strict";</pre>

<p>Although variables don't have types, values do.  A value can be a number, a string,
a boolean, an object, or a function.  A variable that has never been assigned a value
has the special value <i>undefined</i>.  (The fact that a function can be used as a
data value might be a surprise to you; more  on that later.)  You can determine
the type of a value, using the <i>typeof</i> operator:
The expression <code>typeof&nbsp;x</code> returns a string that tells the type of
the value of <i>x</i>.  The string can be "number", "string",
"boolean", "object", "function", or "undefined".  Note that <i>typeof</i> returns "object" 
for objects of any type, including arrays.  Also, <i>typeof&nbsp;null</i> is "object".</p>

<p>In JavaScript, "string" is considered to be a primitive data type
rather than an object type. When two strings are compared  using the
== or != operator, the contents of the strings are compared.
There is no <ptype>char</ptype> type.  String literals can be enclosed either
in double quotes or in single quotes.  Strings can be concatenated with
the + operator, like in Java.</p>

<p>There is not a strict distinction between integers and
real numbers.  Both are of type "number".  In JavaScript, unlike Java and C, 
division of integers produces a real number, so that 1/2 in
JavaScript is 0.5, not 0 as it would be in Java.</p>

<p>Although there is a boolean type, with literal values <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>,
you can actually use any type of value in a boolean context.
So, you will often see tests in JavaScript such as</p>

<pre>if (x) { ... }</pre>

<np>The value of <i>x</i> as a boolean is considered to be false if
 <i>x</i> is the number zero or is the empty string or is <i>null</i>
or is <i>undefined</i>.
Effectively, any type of value can be converted implicitly to boolean</np>

<p>In fact, JavaScript does many implicit conversions that you might not expect.
For example, when comparing a number to string using the == operator, JavaScript will
try to convert the string into a number.  So, the value of <i>17&nbsp;==&nbsp;&leftquote;17"</i> is
<i>true</i>.  The value of <i>""&nbsp;==&nbsp;0</i> is also <i>true</i>, since in this case
JavaScript converts both operands to boolean.  Since this behavior is not always what you
want, JavaScript has operators === and !== that are similar to == and != except that they
never do type conversion on their operands.  S0, for example, <i>17&nbsp;===&nbsp;&leftquote;17"</i>
is <i>false</i>.</p>

<p>JavaScript will also try to convert a string to a number if you multiply, 
divide, or subtract a string and a number&mdash;but not if you add them, since 
in that case it interprets the + operator as string concatenation, and it converts 
the number into to a string.</p>

<p>JavaScript does not have type-casting as it exists in Java.  However,
you can use <i>Number</i>, <i>String</i>, and <i>Boolean</i> as conversion
functions.  For example,</p>

<pre>x = Number(y);</pre>

<np>will attempt to convert <i>y</i> to a number.  You can apply this,
for example, when <i>y</i> is a string.  If the conversion fails, the value of
<i>x</i> will be <i>NaN</i>, a special value indicating "Not a Number."
The <i>Number</i> function converts the empty string to zero.</np>

<p>Mathematical functions in JavaScript are defined in a <i>Math</i> object, which is similar 
to the <classname>Math</classname> class in Java.  For example, there are
functions <i>Math.sin</i>(<i>x</i>), <i>Math.cos</i>(<i>x</i>), <i>Math.abs</i>(<i>x</i>), 
and <i>Math.sqrt</i>(<i>x</i>).  <i>Math.PI</i> is the mathematical constant &pi;.
<i>Math.random</i>() is a function that returns a random number in the range 0.0 to
1.0, including 0.0 but excluding 1.0.</p>

<break/>

<p>JavaScript control structures are pretty much the same as in Java or C,
including <i>if</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>do</i><code>..</code><i>while</i>,
and <i>switch</i>.  JavaScript has a <i>try</i><code>..</code><i>catch</i> statement
for handling exceptions that is similar to Java's, but since variables are untyped, there is
only one <i>catch</i> block, and it does not declare a type for
the exception.  (That is, you say, "catch&nbsp;(e)" rather than
"catch(Exception&nbsp;e)".)  An error can be generated using the <i>throw</i>
statement.  Any type of value can be thrown.  You might,
for example, throw a string that represents an error message:</p>

<pre>throw "Sorry, that value is illegal.";</pre>

<p>Functions in JavaScript are defined using the <i>function</i> keyword.
Since variables are untyped, no return type is declared and
parameters do not have declared types.  Here is a typical
function definition:</p>

<pre>function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}</pre>

<np>A function can return any type of value, or it can return nothing
(like a <i>void</i> method in Java).  In fact, the same function might sometimes
return a value and sometimes not, although that would not be good style.
JavaScript does not require the number of parameters in a function call to
match the number of parameters in the definition of the function.  If you provide too
few parameters in the function call, then the extra parameters in the function
definition get the value <i>undefined</i>.  You can check for this in the
function by testing if the <i>typeof</i> the parameter is "undefined".
There can be a good reason for doing this:  It makes it possible to have
optional parameters.  For example, consider</np>

<pre>function multiple( str, count ) {
     if ( typeof count == "undefined" ) {
         count = 2;
     }
     var i;
     var copies = "";
     for (i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
         copies += str;
     }
     return copies;
}</pre>

<np>If no value is provided for <i>count</i>, as in the function call <i>multiple</i>("boo"),
then <i>count</i> will be set to&nbsp;2.  Note by the way that declaring a variable in a function
makes it local to the function.  In fact, a variable that is declared in a function
can be used anywhere in that function, even before its declaration.
Functions can also access global variables.</np>

<p>You can also provide extra values in a function call.  All the values provided
are always available in the function in a special variable named <i>arguments</i>,
which is essentially an array.  For example, this makes it possible to write a
<i>sum</i> function that takes any number of input values:</p>

<pre>function sum() {
    var i;
    var total = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
         total += arguments[i];
    }
    return total;
}</pre>

<np>With this definition, you can call <i>sum</i>(2,2),
<i>sum</i>(1,2,3,4,5), and even <i>sum</i>().  (The value of the
last function call is zero.)</np>

<p>It is possible to define a function inside another function.  The nested
function is then local to the function in which it is nested, and can only
be used inside that function.  This lets you define a "helper function" inside the
function that uses it, instead of adding the helper function to the global
namespace.</p>

<break/>

<p>Functions in JavaScript are "first class objects."  This means that functions
are treated as regular data values, and you can do the sort of things with
them that you do with data:  assign them to variables, store them in arrays,
pass them as parameters to functions, return them from functions.  In
fact, it is very common to do all of these things!</p>

<p>When you define a function using a definition like the ones in the
examples shown above, it's almost the same as assigning a function to
a variable.  For example, given the above definition of the function <i>sum</i>,
you can assign <i>sum</i> to a variable or pass it as a parameter, and you
would be assigning or passing the function.  And if the value of a variable
is a function, you can use the variable just as you would use the function
name, to call the function.  That is, if you do</p>

<pre>var f = sum;</pre>

<np>then you can call <i>f</i>(1,2,3), and it will be the  same
as calling <i>sum</i>(1,2,3).  (One difference between defining a function
and assigning a variable is that a function defined by a function definition
can be used anywhere in the program, even before the function definition.
Before it starts executing the program,
the computer reads the entire program to find all the functions that
it contains.)</np>

<p>JavaScript even has something like "function literals."  That is, there is a way of
writing a function data value just at the point where you need it, without
giving it a name or defining it with a standard function definition.  Such
functions are called "anonymous functions." The
syntax looks like a function definition without a name. Here, for example,
an anonymous function is created and passed as the first parameter to a
function named <i>setTimeout</i>:</p>

<pre>setTimeout( function () {
    alert("Time's Up!");
}, 5000 );</pre>

<np>To do the same thing without anonymous functions would require defining a standard
named function that is only going to be used once:</np>

<pre>function alertFunc() {
    alert("Time's Up!");
}

setTimeout( alertFunc, 5000 );</pre>

<p>In C, functions can be assigned to variables and passed as parameters to functions.
However, there are no anonymous functions in&nbsp;C.  Anonymous functions are one
of JavaScript's distinctive features.  Something similar has been added to Java&nbsp;8
in the form of "lambda expressions."</p>

</subsection>




<subsection title="Arrays and Objects" id="proglang.3.2">

<p>An array in JavaScript is an object, which includes several methods for working
with the array.  The elements in an array
can be of any type; in fact, different elements in the same array can have different
types. An array value can be created as a list of values between [&nbsp;and&nbsp;].  For example:</p>

<pre>var A = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
var B = [ "foo", "bar" ];
var C = [];</pre>

<np>The last line in this example creates an empty array, which initially
has length zero.  An array can also be created using a <word>constructor</word> that specifies
the initial size of the array:</np>

<pre>var D = new Array(100);  // space for 100 elements</pre>

<np>Initially, the elements of <i>D</i> all have the value <i>undefined</i>.</np>

<p>The length of an array is not fixed.  (This makes JavaScript arrays more similar to Java
<classname>ArrayLists</classname> than they are to Java arrays.)  
If <i>A</i> is an array, its current length is <i>A.length</i>.
The <i>push</i> method can be used to add a new element to the end of an
array, increasing its length by one: <i>A.push</i>(6).  The <i>pop</i> method removes
and returns the last item: <i>A.pop</i>().  In fact, it is legal to assign
a value to an array element that does not yet exist:</p>

<pre>var E = [ 1, 2, 3 ];  // E has length 3
E[100] = 17;  // E now has length 101.</pre>

<np>In this example, when a value is assigned to <i>E</i>[100], the length of the
array is increased to make it large enough to hold the new element.</np>

<p>Because of their flexibility, standard JavaScript arrays are not very efficient for
working with arrays of numbers.  Modern web browsers define <word term="typed array">typed arrays</word>
for numerical applications.  For example, an array of type <i>Int32Array</i>
can only hold values that are 32-bit integers. Typed arrays are used extensively in
<word>WebGL</word>; they are covered in this book when they are needed.</p>

<break/>

<p>JavaScript has objects, but it doesn't exactly have classes, at least not in
the sense that Java or C++ does.  An object is essentially a collection of
key/value pairs, where a key is a name, like an instance variable or method
name in Java, which has an associated value.  The term "instance variable" 
is not usually used in JavaScript; the preferred term is "property."</p>

<p>The value of a property of an object can be an
ordinary data value or a function (which is just another type of data
value in JavaScript).  It is possible to create an object as a list of
key/value pairs, enclosed by {&nbsp;and&nbsp;}.  For example,</p>

<pre>var pt = {  x: 17, y: 42 };

var ajaxData = {
    url: "http://some.place.org/ajax.php",
    data: 42,
    onSuccess: function () { alert("It worked!"); },
    onFailure: function (error) { alert("Sorry, it failed: " + error); }
};</pre>

<np>With these definitions, <i>pt</i> is an object.  It has properties
<i>pt.x</i>, with value 17, and <i>pt.y</i>, with value 42.  <i>ajaxData</i>
is another object with properties including <i>ajaxData.url</i>
and <i>ajaxData.onSuccess</i>.  The value of <i>ajaxData.onSuccess</i>
is a function, created here as an anonymous function.
Objects are open in the sense that you can add
a new property to an existing object at any time just by assigning
a value.  For example, given the object <i>pt</i> defined above, you can
say</np>

<pre>pt.z = 84;</pre>

<np>This adds <i>z</i> as a new property of the object, with initial value 84.</np>

<p>Although JavaScript doesn't (quite) have classes, it does have constructors,
which can be called with the <i>new</i> operator to create objects.
For example, </p>

<pre>var now = new Date();</pre>

<np>This calls the constructor <i>Date</i>(), which is a standard part
of JavaScript.  When called with no parameters, <i>new&nbsp;Date</i>() constructs
an object that represents the current date and time.</np>

<p>A constructor is written like an ordinary function; by convention, the name of
a constructor function begins with an upper case letter.  In some sense,
a constructor actually defines a class.  <i>Date</i>, for example, is often
referred to as a class.  It is possible to write a function that can be used
as a constructor, and doing so defines something that is as close to a class
as JavaScript comes.  For example, let's see how to define a class to
represent points in 2D:</p>

<pre>function Point2D(x,y) {
    if ( typeof x != "undefined") {
        this.x = x;
    }
    else {
        this.x = 0;
    }
    if ( typeof y != "undefined" ) {
        this.y = y;
    }
    else {
        this.y = 0;
    }
    this.move = function(dx,dy) {
        this.x = this.x + dx;
        this.y = this.y + dy;
    }
}</pre>

<np>When called with the <i>new</i> operator, this function creates
an object that has properties <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>move</i>.
The fact that the value of <i>move</i> is a function makes it more like
an instance method than an instance variable.  Consider:</np>

<pre>var p1 = new Point2D(17,42);
var p2 = new Point2D();</pre>

<np>The values of <i>p1</i> and <i>p2</i> are objects. We would
say that they are "objects of type <classname>Point2D"</classname>.  The value of <i>p1.x</i>
is 17, and the value of <i>p1.y</i> is 42.  Calling <i>p1.move</i>(1,2) will change
the values of these properties to <i>p1.x = 18</i> and <i>p1.y = 44</i>.
(It is also possible to change these variables directly with assignment
statements.)  Note that <i>p2</i> is created with the default value of zero
for <i>p2.x</i> and <i>p2.y</i>.</np>

<p>The definition of the <i>move</i> method in this example is not done
in the best way possible.  The problem is that every object of type
<classname>Point2D</classname> gets its own copy of <i>move</i>.
That is, the code that defines <i>move</i> is duplicated for each
object that is created.  The solution is to use something called the
"prototype" of the function <i>Point2D</i>.</p>

<p>This might take us farther into the details of JavaScript than we really need to go,
but here is how it works:
Every object has a prototype, which is another object.  Properties of the 
prototype are considered to be properties of the object, unless the object
is given its own property of the same name.  When several objects have the same prototype,
those objects share the properties of the prototype.  Now, when an object is
created by a constructor function, the prototype of the constructor becomes
the prototype of the new object that it creates.  This means that properties
that are added to the prototype of a constructor function are shared by
all the objects that are created by that function.  This allows us to improve
the definition of <i>Point2D</i> as follows:</p>

<pre>function Point2D(x,y) {
    if (x) {
        this.x = x;
    }
    else {
        this.x = 0;
    }
    if (y) {
        this.y = y;
    }
    else {
        this.y = 0;
    }
}

Point2D.prototype.move = function(dx,dy) {
    this.x = this.x + dx;
    this.y = this.y + dy;
}</pre>
    
<np>The properties of the prototype are shared by all objects
of type <classname>Point2D</classname>.  In this case, there
is a single copy of <i>move</i> in the prototype, which is used by all such objects.</np>

<p>The definition of <i>Point2D</i> uses the special variable <i>this</i> to refer to the
object that is being constructed, so that <i>this.x</i> and <i>this.y</i> refer to
properties of that object.  In the definition of <i>move</i>, <i>this</i> refers
to the object that is used to call the function.  That is, when executing the
statement <i>pt.move</i>(a,b), <i>this</i> refers to <i>pt</i>.  (This is subtly different
from the meaning of <i>this</i> in Java.)  The use of <i>this</i> is mandatory in JavaScript;
it is never possible to abbreviate "<i>this.x</i>" as just&nbsp;&leftquote;<i>x</i>".</p>

<break/>

<p>It is possible in JavaScript to make things that act like subclasses, and you might
need to do that to implement complex data structures such as <word term="scene graph">scene graphs</word>.
I will very briefly discuss one way to do it:  The prototype object for the subclass should
be an object belonging to the superclass.  The prototype has a property named <i>constructor</i>;
the value of the property for the subclass prototype should be set equal to the subclass constructor
function.  The subclass constructor needs to call the superclass constructor.  This
can be done using the <i>call</i>() method of the superclass constructor function.
The parameters to <i>call</i>() should be <i>this</i> followed by any parameters that
are required by the superclass constructor.  You will probably have to do some research
to understand all this, but here is an outline of what the code will look like:</p>

<pre>function MainClass(a,b) {  // Constructor for the superclass.
    ... // initialize properties common to this class and all subclasses
}
...  // Add some methods to MainClass.prototype

function SubClass(a,b,c,d) {  // Constructor for the subclass.
    MainClass.call(this,a,b); // Call the superclass constructor.
    ... // initialize extra properties needed for this subclass
}
SubClass.prototype = new MainClass();  // Use a MainClass object as prototype.
SubClass.prototype.constructor = SubClass;  // Change its constructor property.
...  // Add some methods to SubClass.prototype</pre>

</subsection>




<subsection title="JavaScript on Web Pages" id="proglang.3.3">

<p>There are three ways to include JavaScript code on web pages (that is, in HTML files).
First, you can include it inside &lt;script&gt; elements, which have the form</p>

<pre>&lt;script&gt;
    
    // ... JavaScript code goes here ...
    
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<np>You will sometimes see a <i>type</i> attribute in the first line, as in</np>

<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;</pre>

<np>The attribute specifies the programming language used for the script.  However, in 
HTML5, the value "text/javascript" is the default and the <i>type</i> attribute is not
required for JavaScript scripts.</np>

<p>Second, you can put JavaScript code in a separate file, usually with a
name ending with ".js", and import that
file into the web page.  A JavaScript file can be imported using a variation of the
&lt;script&gt; tag that has the form</p>

<pre>&lt;script src="filename.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<np>where "filename.js" should be replaced by the URL, relative or
absolute, of the JavaScript file.  The closing tag, &lt;/script&gt;, is
required here to mark the end of the script, even though it is <b>not</b> permitted
to have any code inside the script element.  (If you do, it will be ignored.)
Importing JavaScript code from a file in this way has the same effect as typing the
code from the file directly into the web page.</np>

<p>Script elements of either type are often included in the &lt;head&gt; section of
an HTML file, but they actually occur at any point in the file.  You can use any number
of script elements on the same page.  A script can include statements such as function
calls and assignment statements, as well as variable and function declarations.</p>

<p>The third way to use JavaScript on a web page is in event
handlers that can occur inside HTML elements.  For example, consider</p>

<pre>&lt;h1 onclick="doClick()"&gt;My Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>

<np>Here, the <i>onclick</i> attribute defines an event handler that will
be executed when the user clicks on the text of the &lt;h1&gt; element.  The value
of an event handler attribute such as <i>onclick</i> can be any JavaScript code.
It can include multiple statements, separated by semicolons, and can even extend over several lines.
Here, the code is "doClick()", so that clicking the &lt;h1&gt; element
will cause the JavaScript function <i>doClick</i>() to be called.  I should note
that this is a very old-fashioned way to attach an event handler to an element,
and it should not be considered good style.  There are better alternatives
that I will mention later.  Nevertheless, I sometimes do things the old-fashioned way.</np>

<p>It is important to understand that all the JavaScript code in &lt;script&gt; elements,
including code in imported files, is read and executed as the page is being loaded.  Usually,
most of the code in such scripts consists of variable initializations and the definitions
of functions that are meant to be called after the page has loaded, in response to events.
Furthermore, all the scripts on a page are part of the same program.  For example, you
can define a variable or function in one script, even in an imported file, and then use
it in another script.</p>

<break/>
    
<p>JavaScript for web pages has several standard functions that allow you to
interact with the user using dialog boxes.  The simplest of these is
<i>alert</i>(<i>message</i>), which will display <i>message</i> to the user
in a popup dialog box, with an "OK" button that the user can click to dismiss the
message.</p>

<p>The function <i>prompt</i>(<i>question</i>) will display <i>question</i> in a dialog
box, along with an input field where the user can enter a response.  The <i>prompt</i>
function returns the user's response as its return value.   This type of dialog
box comes with an "OK" button and with a "Cancel" button.  If the user hits
"Cancel", the return value from <i>prompt</i> is <i>null</i>.  If the user hits
"OK", the return value is the content of the input field, which might be the empty
string.</p>

<p>The function <i>confirm</i>(<i>question</i>) displays <i>question</i> in a dialog
box along with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.  The return value is <i>true</i> or
<i>false</i>, depending on whether the user hits "OK" or "Cancel".</p>

<p>Here, for example, is a simple guessing game that uses these functions for
user interaction:</p>

<pre>alert("I will pick a number between 1 and 100.\n"
         + "Try to guess it!");
         
do {

    var number = Math.floor( 1 + 100*Math.random() );
    var guesses = 1;
    var guess = Number( prompt("What's your guess?") );
    while (guess != number ) {
        if ( isNaN(guess) || guess &lt; 1 || guess &gt; 100 ) { 
            guess = Number( prompt("Please enter an integer\n" +
                              "in the range 1 to 100") );
        }
        else if (guess &lt; number) {
            guess = Number( prompt("Too low.  Try again!") );
            guesses++;
        }
        else {
            guess = Number( prompt("Too high.  Try again!") );
            guesses++;

<np>(This program uses <i>Number</i>() to convert the user's
response to a number.  If the response cannot be
parsed as a number, then the value will be the not-a-number value <i>NaN</i>.
The function <i>isNaN</i>(<i>guess</i>) is used to check whether the value
of <i>guess</i> is this special not-a-number value.  It's not possible to do
that by saying "if&nbsp;(guess&nbsp;==&nbsp;NaN)" since the
expression NaN&nbsp;==&nbsp;NaN evaluates to <i>false</i>!
The same, by the way, is true of the not-a-number value in Java.)</np>

<p>You can try out JavaScript code in the JavaScript consoles that
are available in many web browsers.  In the Chrome browser, for example, you can access a console
in the menu under "More&nbsp;Tools" / "Developer Tools", then click the "Console" tab in the developer
tools.  This will show the
web console at the bottom of the Chrome window, with a JavaScript input prompt.
The console can also be detached into a separate window.
When you type a line of JavaScript and press return, it is executed, and its
value is output in the console.  The code is evaluated in the context of the current web
page, so you can even enter commands that affect that page.  The Web console also shows
JavaScript errors that occur when code on the current web page is executed, and JavaScript
code can write a message to the console by calling <i>console.log</i>(<i>message</i>).
All this makes the console very useful for debugging.</p>

<p>Other browsers have similar developer tools.  For the JavaScript console in Firefox,
look for "Browser&nbsp;Console" under "Developer" or "Web Developer" in the menu.
In the Safari browser, use "Show&nbsp;Error&nbsp;Console" in the "Develop" menu (but note that the
Develop menu has to be enabled in the Safari Preferences, under the "Advanced" tab).
In Internet Explorer or Edge browser, access "Developer Tools" by hitting the F12 key.</p>

<p>When an error occurs on a web page, you don't get any notification, except for some
output in the console.  So, if your script doesn't seem to be working, the first thing you
should do is open the console and look for an error message.  When you are doing JavaScript
development, you might want to keep the console always open.</p>

<subsection title="Interacting with the Page" id="proglang.3.4">

<p>JavaScript code on a web page can manipulate the content and the style of
that page.  It can do this because of the <word>DOM</word>
(Document Object Model).  When a web page is loaded,
everything on the page is encoded into a data structure, defined by the DOM,
which can be accessed from JavaScript as a collection of objects.  There are
several ways to get references to these objects, but I will discuss only one:
<i>document.getElementById</i>.  Any element on a web page can have an <i>id</i>
attribute.  For example:</p>

<pre>&lt;img src="somepicture.jpg" id="pic"&gt;</pre>

<np>or</np>

<pre>&lt;h1 id="mainhead"&gt;My Page&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>

<np>An id should be unique on the page, so that an element is uniquely
identified by its id.  Any element is represented by a DOM object.  If an element
has an id, you can obtain a reference to the corresponding DOM object by passing
the id to the function <i>document.getElementById</i>.  For example:</np>

<pre>var image = document.getElementById("pic");
var heading = document.getElementById("mainhead");</pre>

<p>Once you have a DOM object, you can use it to manipulate the element that it
represents.  For example, the content of the element is given by the
<i>innerHTML</i> property of the object.  The value is a string containing
text or HTML code.  In our example, the value of
<i>heading.innerHTML</i> is the string "My&nbsp;Page".  Furthermore, you
can assign a value to this property, and doing so will change the content
of the element. For example:</p>

<pre>heading.innerHTML = "Best Page Ever!";</pre>

<np>This does not just change the value of the property in the object;
it actually changes the text that is displayed on the web page!  This will seem odd (and maybe even a little creepy)
to programmers who are new to JavaScript: It's an assignment statement that has a side effect.  But that's
the way the DOM works.  A change to the DOM data structure that represents a web
page will actually modify the page and change its display in the web browser.</np>

<p>Some attributes of elements become properties of the objects that represent them.
This is true for the <i>src</i> attribute of an image element, so that in our
example, we could say</p>

<pre>image.src = "anotherpicture.jpg";</pre>

<np>This will change the source of the image element.  Again, this is a "live"
assignment: When the assignment statement is executed, the image on the web page
changes.</np>

<p>For readers who know <word>CSS</word>, note that
the DOM object for an element has a property named <i>style</i> that is itself
an object, representing the CSS style of the object.   The <i>style</i> object
has properties such as <i>color</i>, <i>backgroundColor</i>, and <i>fontSize</i>
representing CSS properties.  By assigning values to these properties, you can
change the appearance of the element on the page.  For example,</p>

<pre>heading.color = "red";
heading.fontSize = "150%";</pre>

<np>These commands will make the text in the &lt;h1&gt; element red and 50% larger than usual.
The value of a style property must be a string that would be a legal value for the corresponding
CSS style.</np>

<p>Most interesting along these lines, perhaps, are properties of input elements, since
they make it possible to program interaction with the user.  Suppose that in the HTML
source of a web page, we have</p>

<pre>&lt;input type="text" id="textin"&gt;

&lt;select id="sel"&gt;
   &lt;option value="1"&gt;Option 1&lt;/option&gt;
   &lt;option value="2"&gt;Option 2&lt;/option&gt;
   &lt;option value="3"&gt;Option 3&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;input type="checkbox" id="cbox"&gt;</pre>

<np>and in JavaScript, we have</np>

<pre>var textin = document.getElementById("textin");
var sel = document.getElmenntById("sel");
var checkbox = document.getElementById("cbox");</pre>


<np>Then the value of the property <i>checkbox.checked</i> is a boolean that
can be tested to determine whether the checkbox is checked or not, and the value
<i>true</i> or <i>false</i> can be assigned to <i>checkbox.checked</i>
to check or uncheck the box programmatically.  The value of
<i>checkbox.disabled</i> is a boolean that tells whether the checkbox is disabled.
(The user can't change the value of a disabled checkbox.)  Again, you can both test
and set this value.  The properties <i>sel.disabled</i> and <i>textin.disabled</i> do
the same thing for the &lt;select&gt; menu and the text input box.
The properties <i>textin.value</i> and <i>sel.value</i> represent the current values of
those elements.  The value of a text input is the text that is currently in the box.
The value of a &lt;select&gt; element is the value of the currently selected
option.  As an example, here is complete source code for a 
<tex>web page</tex><web><a href="guessing-game.html">web&nbsp;page</a></web> that implements a
guessing game using a text input box and buttons:</np>

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Guessing Game&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    "use strict";
    var number = Math.floor( 1 + 100*Math.random() );
    var guessCount = 0;
    var guessMessage = "Your guesses so far: ";
    function guess() {
        var userNumber = Number( document.getElementById("guess").value );
        document.getElementById("guess").value = "";
        if ( isNaN(userNumber) || userNumber &lt; 1 || userNumber &gt; 100 ) {
            document.getElementById("question").innerHTML =
               "Bad input!&lt;br&gt;Try again with an integer in the range 1 to 100.";
        }
        else if (userNumber == number) {
            guessCount++;
            document.getElementById("question").innerHTML =
                "You got it in " + guessCount + " guesses. " +
                userNumber + " is correct.&lt;br&gt;" + 
                "I have picked another number.  Make a guess!";
            number = Math.floor( 1 + 100*Math.random() );
            guessCount = 0;
            guessMessage = "Your guesses so far: ";
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "";
        }
        else if (userNumber &lt; number) {
            guessCount++;
            document.getElementById("question").innerHTML =
                userNumber + " is too low.&lt;br&gt;Try again.";
            guessMessage += " " + userNumber;
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = guessMessage;
        }
        else {
            guessCount++;
            document.getElementById("question").innerHTML =
                userNumber + " is too high.&lt;br&gt;Try again.";
            guessMessage += " " + userNumber;
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = guessMessage;
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p id="question"&gt;I will pick a number between 1 and 100.&lt;br&gt;
     Try to guess it.  What is your first guess?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" id="guess"&gt;
       &lt;button onclick="guess()"&gt;Make Guess&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id="message"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>


<break/>
    
<p>Here's one problem with some of my discussion.  Suppose that a script uses
<i>document.getElementById</i> to get the DOM object for some HTML element. If that
script is executed before the page has finished loading, the element that it is
trying to access might not yet
exist.  And remember that scripts are executed as the page is loading.  Of course,
one solution is to call <i>document.getElementById</i> only in functions that
are executed in response to events that can only occur after the page has loaded; 
that's what I did in the previous example.
But sometimes, you want to assign a DOM object to a global variable.  Where should
you do that?  One possibility is to put the script at the end of the page.  That
will probably work.  Another, more common technique is to put the assignment into
a function and arrange for that function to run after the page has finished loading. When the browser
has finished loading the page and building its DOM representation, it fires an
<i>onload</i> event.  You can arrange for some JavaScript code to be called in
response to that event.  A common way of doing this is to add an <i>onload</i>
event-handler to the &lt;body&gt; tag:
</p>

<pre>&lt;body onload="init()"&gt;</pre>

<np>This will call a function named <i>init</i>() when the page has loaded.
That function should include any initialization code that your program needs.</np>

<p>You can define similar event-handlers in other elements.
For example, for &lt;input&gt; and &lt;select&gt; elements,
you can supply an <i>onchange</i> event-handler that will be executed when
the user changes the value associated with the element. This
allows you to respond when the user checks or unchecks a checkbox or selects
a new option from a select menu.</p> 

<p>It's possible to include an event handler for an element in the HTML tag that
creates the element, as I did with the <i>body onload</i> event. But that's not the preferred way to set up event handling.
For one thing, the mixing of JavaScript code and HTML code is often considered to be
bad style.  Alternatively, there are two other ways to install event handlers using the DOM.  Suppose that
<i>checkbox</i> is a DOM object representing a check box element, probably obtained
by calling <i>document.getElementById</i>.  That object has a property named
<i>onchange</i> that represents an event-handler for the checkbox's onchange event.
You can set up event handling by assigning a function to that property.
If <i>checkBoxChanged</i> is the function that you want to call when the user
checks or unchecks the box, you can use the JavaScript command:</p>

<pre>checkbox.onchange = checkBoxChanged;</pre>

<np>You could also use an anonymous function:</np>

<pre>checkbox.onchange = function() { alert("Checkbox changed"); };</pre>

<np>Note that the value of <i>checkbox.onchange</i> is a function, not a string
of JavaScript code.</np>


<p>The other way to set up event handling in JavaScript is 
with the <i>addEventListener</i> function (at least
in modern browsers, including all of those that support the HTML canvas element).
This technique is more flexible because it allows you to set up more than one event handler for
the same event.
This function is a method in any DOM element object.  Using it, our checkbox
example becomes</p>

<pre>checkbox.addEventListener( "change", checkBoxChanged, false );</pre>

<np>The first parameter to <i>addEventListener</i>
is a string that gives the name of the event. The name is
the same as the name of the event attribute in HTML, with "on" stripped off the front:
<i>onchange</i> becomes "change".  The second parameter is the function that will be called
when the event occurs.  It can be given as the name of a function or as an
anonymous function. The third parameter is harder to explain and will, for 
our purposes, always be false. You can remove an event listener from an element
by calling <i>element.removeEventListener</i> with the same parameters that were
used in the call to <i>element.addEventListener</i>.
 </np>

<p>Similarly, there is an <i>onmousedown</i> event that is defined for any element.
A handler for this event can be attached to a DOM element, <i>elem</i>, either
by assigning a function to <i>elem.onmousedown</i> or by calling
<i>elem.addEventListener</i>("mousedown",handler,false).  Other common events include
<i>onmouseup</i>, <i>onmousemove</i>, <i>onclick</i>, and <i>onkeydown</i>.  An
<i>onkeydown</i> event handler responds when the user presses a key on the keyboard.  The
handler is often attached to the document object:</p>

<pre>document.onkeydown = doKeyPressed;</pre>

<p>An event-handler function can take a parameter that contains information about the event.
For example, in an event-handler for mouse events, using <i>evt</i> as the name of the parameter,
<i>evt.clientX</i> and <i>evt.clientY</i> give the location of the mouse
in the browser window.  In a handler for the <i>onkeydown</i> event, <i>evt.keyCode</i> is
a numeric code for the key that was pressed.</p>

<p>Event handling is a complicated subject, and I have given only a short introduction here.
As a first step in learning more about events in JavaScript, you might look at the sample
program <sourceref href="canvas2d/EventsStarter.html"/>.</p>
