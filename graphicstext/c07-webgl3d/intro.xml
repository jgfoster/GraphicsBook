<intro>

<p1>The previous chapter covered WebGL, but only in the context of
two-dimensional graphics.  As we move into 3D, we will have to
work with more complex <word term="geometric transform">transformations</word>.
For that, we will rely mainly on an open-source JavaScript library for 
vector and matrix math. We will also need to implement
<word>lighting</word> and <word>material</word>, which we will
do directly in <word>GLSL</word>.</p1>

<p>We begin the chapter by duplicating most of the capabilities of <word>OpenGL</word>&nbsp;1.1
that were covered in <localref href="gl1geom"/> and <localref href="gl1light"/>.
But we will soon move beyond that by adding features such as
<word term="spotlight">spotlights</word>, <word>Phong shading</word>, and
<word>environment mapping</word>.</p>
