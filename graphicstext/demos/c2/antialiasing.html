    <h1>Antialiasing Exercise</h1>
    <p>Because a mathematical line has no width, it is impossible to see.
      In computer graphics we need to give lines a width in order to see
      them. The minimum width is a pixel, so if a line goes at right 
      angles from edge to edge and through the center of a pixel, then the 
      pixel is completely filled. But if a line is between two pixels, 
      then, in theory, it should cover only half of the neighboring pixels. 
      Since an entire pixel can only be one color, the convention is 
      to use shading to approximate the coverage. So, a pixel covered by 
      50% of a line is shaded at 50% and a pixel covered by 25% of a line
      is shared at 25%. Note that while a line has width, it does not 
      (by default) extend beyond the endpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this exercise, draw the line (as in a previous exercise). Then add shading 
      to the pixels around the line by shift-clicking on the pixels. Repeated 
      clicks will cycle through the shading options (25%, 50%, 75%, and 
      100%). The cell will show one to four dots to identify the shading.
