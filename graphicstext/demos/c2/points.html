    <h1>Point Exercise</h1>
    <p>In mathematics, a <i>point</i> (in a two-dimensional space) 
      is an infinitely small location identified by (X, Y) coordinates.
      Because a pixel has some size, it contains an infinite number of
      points. By convention, integer coordinates refer to the 
      (infinitely narrow) lines between pixels. Non-integer coordinates
      can be used to identify points between the lines. We can also use
      negative numbers to identify points less than zero.
