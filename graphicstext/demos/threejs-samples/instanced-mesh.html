/* Demonstrates the use of THREE.InstancedMesh to drow
 * large numbers of copies of an object.  The basic object
 * is a sphere.  It used to make an 11-by-11-by-11 cube
 * of colored spheres.  An InstancedMesh allows each instance
 * to have its own color and transformation; those are the
 * only property that can vary.
 *    This program uses WebGL2, which might not be available
 * in all web browsers.  It also works with a WebGL1Rendered,
 * but that presumably doesn't support true hardware instancing.
